                <h2>Step 2: Prepare the Solution</h2>
                <p>Dissolve borate powder (such as borax and boric acid) in warm water to create a borate solution. The concentration can vary, but a common ratio is 1:1:10 (boric acid:borax:water by weight) for a 10% solution, which is effective for bamboo
                    preservation.

                <h2>Step 3: Apply the Borate Solution</h2>
                <p>Soak the bamboo poles in the borate solution. This can be done through immersion in a large tank or trough for several days, ensuring the solution penetrates deeply into the bamboo. Alternatively, for a quicker method, use a pressure treatment
                    system if available.</p>
                <p>As a more accessible alternative, especially for small-scale or DIY projects, apply the borate solution using brushes or spray bottles, thoroughly saturating all surfaces of the bamboo. Multiple applications may be necessary to ensure
                    deep penetration.</p>

                <h2>Step 4: Dry the Bamboo</h2>
                <p>After treatment, allow the bamboo to dry slowly in a shaded, well-ventilated area to prevent cracking. Avoid direct sunlight and excessive heat, as rapid drying can cause the bamboo to split. This process can take several weeks depending
                    on the climate and bamboo thickness.</p>

            <a href="step5.html" class="card">
                <h2>Step 5: Regular Maintenance and Inspection</h2>
                <p>Inspect the treated bamboo regularly for signs of pest activity or decay. Although borate treatment significantly increases bamboo's resistance to pests and fungi, environmental conditions can lead to eventual breakdown.</p>
                <p>Reapply the borate solution every few years or as needed, depending on the bamboo's exposure to the elements and signs of wear or damage.</p>
