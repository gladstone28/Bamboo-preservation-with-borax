        <h2>Application Methods</h2>
        <p>To ensure the bamboo is well-preserved, the borate solution needs to be thoroughly applied. There are several methods to do this:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Soaking:</strong> Submerge the bamboo in the borate solution for at least 72 hours. This method ensures deep penetration of the solution into the bamboo fibers.</li>
            <li><strong>Brushing or Spraying:</strong> If soaking is not feasible, you can also apply the solution using a brush or spray. This may require multiple applications to ensure adequate coverage and absorption.</li>
            <li><strong>Pressure Treating:</strong> For commercial operations, pressure treating the bamboo with the solution ensures deep penetration and uniform treatment.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Ensuring Effective Treatment</h2>
        <p>After applying the solution, allow the bamboo to rest for a few hours to ensure the solution is absorbed properly. For soaking, ensure that the bamboo is fully submerged and consider using weights to keep it under the solution.</p>
