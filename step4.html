            <h2>Drying Process</h2>
            <p>After applying the borate solution, it is crucial to allow the bamboo to dry properly. This step is essential for the preservation process to be effective. Follow these guidelines to ensure optimal drying:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Avoid Direct Sunlight:</strong> Dry the bamboo in a shaded area to prevent the rapid evaporation of moisture, which can cause cracking and warping.</li>
                <li><strong>Ensure Good Air Circulation:</strong> Place the bamboo in a well-ventilated area to facilitate even drying. Use fans if necessary to improve airflow, especially in humid conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Allow Sufficient Time:</strong> Drying can take several weeks, depending on the thickness of the bamboo and environmental conditions. Patience is key to ensuring the bamboo dries evenly and thoroughly.</li>
                <li><strong>Whether bamboo should be kiln dried depends on the product requirements and available resources. Kiln drying offers faster drying times, improved stability, and pest reduction, making it suitable for commercial operations needing precise moisture control. However, it's more costly and requires careful monitoring to prevent damage. For traditional uses or when resources are limited, air drying may be preferable. The choice between kiln and air drying should consider the bamboo species and the intended use's specific demands.</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Checking for Dryness</h2>
            <p>To determine if the bamboo is fully dried, check its weight. Bamboo that has dried completely will be significantly lighter than when it was wet. Additionally, you can inspect the surface for signs of moisture or feel the bamboo to ensure
                it is dry to the touch. Use of a Moisture Meter could be benficial.</p>
